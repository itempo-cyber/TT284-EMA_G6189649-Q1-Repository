The Role of Wireframes in Web Development
Wireframes serve as a blueprint for web development projects, allowing developers, designers, and stakeholders to visualize the structure and layout of a web application before delving into coding. They facilitate discussion and refinement of ideas, ensuring that the project's requirements are accurately captured and agreed upon. Wireframes focus on layout, content placement, and functionality, setting a clear path for the development process without getting sidetracked by design elements like colors or fonts.
